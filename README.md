# wriggler-qbasic
This is a 1998 prototype QBASIC game, the concept ripped entirely from Romantic Robot's Wrigger on Amstrad CPC.

You can see the original Wriggler on Amstrad and Spectrum here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02Kh076wja8

In 1998, I was 17. This was as far as I got with my crack at it!
